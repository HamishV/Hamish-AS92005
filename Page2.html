  <h1>Affects of Carbon Emissions</h1>
  <h2>Carbon Dioxide isn't necessarily bad as it has some positive effects such as the greenhouse effect which keeps earth at 15°C, a temperature ideal for humans and other species to live and thrive in.
      Without gases such as carbon dioxide to create the greenhouse effect, the Earth’s average temperature would be -18°C. The world would be covered in ice, and life wouldn’t be as we know it. The greenhouse effect is a good thing when it’s in balance.</h2>
  <h2>The problem with carbon dioxide is that it is moving the greenhouse effect out of balance. Before the 1700s, the Earth was at a perfect temperature, it was absorbing solar energy and emitting greenhouse gases at a steady rate. Then, the Industrial Revolution happened. Emissions of greenhouse gases, predominantly carbon dioxide, have been steadily increasing and moving the greenhouse effect out of balance. This means that there are too many greenhouse gases absorbing the sun’s energy, which means that Earth is moving up in temperature.
   Between 2000 and 2020, the Earth’s emissions more than quadrupled from the previous decade. </h2>
