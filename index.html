  <h1>What is Carbon Emissions?</h1>
<h2>Carbon emissions is the release of carbon containing gases including carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. </h2>
  <h1>Where do they come from?</h1>
<h2>Carbon emissions mostly come from the combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) for energy production and transportation among other things.</h2>
<h1>Why do carbon emissions matter?</h1>
<h2>It matters because it is the emission of CO2 from burning fossil fuels. It is considered pollution because of the negative impact this gas has on the planet. It absorbs heat in the form of infrared radiation, so it works like glass in a greenhouse.
Instead of that heat radiating away from the planet, it gets trapped in our atmosphere, warming the Earth. As our atmosphere warms, our climate changes. That is why we are seeing more severe storms, drought, and changing sea levels. A primary climate goal is to reduce carbon emissions.</h2>
